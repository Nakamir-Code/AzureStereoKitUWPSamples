# Azure StereoKit UWP Samples
Whatâ€™s the first thing that anyone creating any enterprise app will need to work out?
- Authentication

This repo contains a [StereoKit](https://stereokit.net/) sample application (for Microsoft Hololens-2) 
that demonstrates user authentication using Microsoft Azure Active Directory.

The application has demonstrations of:
* Logging in / authenticating users via Azure Active Directory before they can use the StereoKit application.
* Token acquisition using MSAL in a StereoKit-UWP application running on Hololens-2.
* Using the acquired token to get data from Microsoft Graph API.
* Using the acquired token to upload a blob to azure blob storage and then read the contents of the blob.
* Both silent and interactive token acquisition is demonstrated.

## Azure Setup:
Please look at the following samples to learn to do all the necessary setups using the Azure Portal.

## Instruction:
In the code, edit the client Id and tenant Id according to your application registration credentials. 
Also, edit the storage account URL according to you Azure Blob Storage setup.

### Contribution:
We made the code open-source so that other StereoKit developers can also start using them in building their 
enterprise applications.
Some of the next features we are intersted in are:
* Instead of typing in user-name and password, we are more intestesd in eye-scan + AAD based authentication.
* Having a sample that demostrates upload of blob data to different storage accounts depending on which tenant the logged in
user is from. e.g. If someone logs in from Company A, he/she will be automatically be uploading to a Azure Storage
Account dedicated for that company A. Similarly, if a user logs in from Company-B, then the link to the blob 
storage acccount automatically gets updated. Currently, this storage account link is hard-coded into the program.
